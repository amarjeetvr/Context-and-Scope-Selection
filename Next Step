I have provided the complete design and architecture plan. To move forward with the submission, you need to execute the code and deployment.
Would you like me to generate a skeletal project structure, including key API endpoint definitions and the basic database schema for the MGNREGA data, to help you start the coding phase?
This is a well-defined project that requires balancing robust engineering with user-centric design for a challenging demographic.
I have outlined a detailed, production-ready plan encompassing the interface design for low-literacy users (using Hindi, simple icons, and contextual questions) and a resilient technical architecture (using a local database, caching with Redis, and a nightly ingestion script) to ensure high uptime and performance, independent of the upstream API.
Since the final submission requires the hosted app URL and a video, my role is to provide the necessary groundwork for your execution.
Next Step: Providing Implementation Scaffolding
To help you move efficiently from design to implementation, I will generate a concrete, actionable outline for the core technical elements based on the plan above.
Would you like me to provide:
A sample PostgreSQL/SQL Database Schema for storing the crucial MGNREGA performance data.
Key Backend API Endpoint Definitions (e.g., /api/v1/district/{district_id}/performance) for the frontend to consume.
The specific MGNREGA metrics translated into the simplified Hindi titles for the UI, ready for use in your frontend code.
